# C++ Notes

Material gathered from the "Introduction to System Engineering" Course from the Technion and from the Internet.

*Notice:* The first couple files refer to advanced C code, later the notes refer to C++.


## Motivation

I keep this as reference for the C++ language.

## Disclaimer

I have copied much of this and also added my own notes. There may be things that are incorrect because of this.
